Our game made for the HTC Vive. Special thanks to Valve and HTC for the opportunity!

In this game we explored the meaning behind what we find ourselves doing over and over again, our rituals, specifically those performed in the morning. Some people make a pot of coffee, others do their dishes, some (not us) do the homework they procrastinated on.

As you play the game you will find the correct rituals to perform from the radio announcer, your voice of reason. As you continue through the increasingly more complicated levels where you obtain more steps to your daily ritual, the world around you will change based on your success or failure. 
Maybe your morning ritual is a little more spiritual/supernatural than you may have thought.

Check out the releases tab for instructions and the executable.

Hope you enjoy!
